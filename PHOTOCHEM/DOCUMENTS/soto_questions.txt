# Alejandro Soto's questions about the Atmos code.

## PHOTOCHEM Questions

  * Is NEQ still used? For what? What is it?
  * What is LDA?
  * How do you define 'diurnal averaging factor (AGL)'
  * What do ISEASON=0, ISEASON=1, and ISEASON=2 mean? Each of them indicate that P and T do not vary with time, but beyond that I don't know if there is a difference. Related questions, do values of 3 or greater for ISEASON have any special meaning? Or do all of those mean the same, i.e., that P and T are varying with time.

## General issues

  * A lot of the content in help_me.txt is out of date and/or wrong.
